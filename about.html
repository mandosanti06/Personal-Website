									<p>Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Armando J. Santiago, a curious 16-year-old hailing from the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Since my early years, technology has always been my passion, especially video games. As a kid, I can still recall the excitement I felt when my parents suggested I attend a programming course, which would eventually set me on the path to a Computer Science career.</p>
									<p>Thankfully, my parents were extremely supportive of my budding interest in programming, and my dad would eagerly ask about what I had learned each day. It was that encouragement and enthusiasm that fueled my passion for coding.</p>
									<p>Over time, I continued to explore the vast world of programming, learning new languages and tools to enhance my skills. Thanks to platforms like Scratch, I was able to build my own games and watch my creations come to life.</p>
									<p>When I enrolled in CIMATEC, my primary objective was to expand my knowledge in programming, and boy, did I achieve that goal! Not only did I get the chance to join the Robotics Club, but I also took on the role of the team's lead programmer. I even mastered the complex programming languages of Python and C++, which allowed me to create sophisticated programs that made my daily routine both efficient and enjoyable.
									</p>
									<p>Looking back, it's incredible to see how far I've come in my programming journey, and I'm excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
