									<p>My name is Arnaldo H. Alicea-Rosario, I am 16 years old, and I was born in Puerto Rico. From when I was smaller, I was always amazed by technology, espacially games. I remember when my parents offered me to go to a programming course, where my Computer Science career started. My parents were always supportive of the idea, my dad would always ask me what I learned, and he could hear the passion for what I did in the course.</p>
									<p>I continued my path towards today, learning the existence of other languages and making my own games using Scratch.</p>
									<p>When I entered CIMATEC, my goals were to extend my knowledge in programming, and my goals were acomplished. I joined the Robotics Club, and became the team's secondary programmer; becoming the primary programmer in the coming years. I also learned Python and C++, and created more advanced programs to make my everyday routine much easier and more fun.</p>
