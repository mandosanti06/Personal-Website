										<h1>The influence of videogames in my life</h1>

								<p>Videogames have been a big part of my life, ever since I was young. The first videogame console my parents gave me was a <a href="https://vtech.fandom.com/wiki/V.Smile">VTech V.Smile</a>, and even though I don't remember much, I remember being amazed at how the characters moved, and interacted with my inputs. Eventually, I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> for my birthday, and I got into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports">Wii Sports</a> and <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>. Motion controls amazed me everytime. I played those 2 games every chance I got, entertaining myself everytime. After some years, I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS">3DS</a> for Christmas, and it opened up new posibilities for me. I completed games with unique mechanics, like <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_%26_Luigi:_Dream_Team">Mario & Luigi: Dream Team</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario:_Sticker_Star">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a>, seeing the differences and the story and everything that made games <em>unique</em>. I started having certain taste for games, not only the ones that I get gifted every holiday. Because of this, my parents stopped gifting me games, instead buying me new games, only if I could buy them with the money that I had saved. Soon after, I got gifted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U">Wii U</a>. I remember feeling so cool getting a new console, since it was very new at the time. The Wii U was very creative with its gimmick, and I liked how it implemented it on their games. It was the last console I recieved as a "gift." 4 years after playing with the Wii U, I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, but this time, I bought it and its games, and it was the first time I really used a console's full potential. I took it everywhere, and I played online, and contacted friends to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite">Fortnite</a> every day I could. This was the stepping stone that got me to where I am today, when I took the interest to build my own PC. It would be perfect. It could do whatever I wanted it to do. And so I started to research. I now finally got to finish it, and I can play games that I didn't even know existed! Videogames have also impacted my social life, which I feel like I have socialized more with friends ever since I went online. At this point, videogames have influenced my interests, my knowledge, and my career.</p>
